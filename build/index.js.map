The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. See\n * examples/wms-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Note that if no transforms are needed and you only need to define the\n * projection, just add a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

Alternatively, a\n * filter function can be provided. The function will be called for each layer\n * in the map and should return `true` for layers that you want to be\n * selectable. If the option is absent, all visible layers will be considered\n * selectable.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike} [style]\n * Style for the selected features.

Use this if you\n * want to use different events for add and remove instead of `toggle`.\n * @property {import(\"../events/condition.js\").Condition} [toggleCondition] A function\n * that takes an {@link module:ol/MapBrowserEvent~MapBrowserEvent} and returns a\n * boolean to indicate whether that event should be handled. This is in addition\n * to the `condition` event. By default,\n * {@link module:ol/events/condition~shiftKeyOnly}, i.e. pressing `shift` as\n * well as the `condition` event, adds that feature to the current selection if\n * it is not currently selected, and removes it if it is. See `add` and `remove`\n * if you want to use different events instead of a toggle.\n * @property {boolean} [multi=false] A boolean that determines if the default\n * behaviour should select only single features or all (overlapping) features at\n * the clicked map position. The default of `false` means single select.\n * @property {import(\"../Collection.js\").default<import(\"../Feature.js\").default>} [features]\n * Collection where the interaction will place selected features. Optional. If\n * not set the interaction will create a collection. In any case the collection\n * used by the interaction is returned by\n * {@link module:ol/interaction/Select~Select#getFeatures}.\n * @property {FilterFunction} [filter] A function\n * that takes an {@link module:ol/Feature} and an\n * {@link module:ol/layer/Layer} and returns `true` if the feature may be\n * selected or `false` otherwise.\n * @property {number} [hitTolerance=0] Hit-detection tolerance.
